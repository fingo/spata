=================

Thanks for taking an interest in improving spata. Here you can find some hints on how to contribute to the project.

How to help
-----------

Different kinds of contributions are welcome, including, but not limited to:
*   improvements in the documentation - scope, accuracy, clarity and language, 
*   providing additional examples on how to use the library,
*   reporting and fixing bugs,
*   refactoring existing code and enhancing tests,
*   proposing and implementing improvements and new features.

In case of any doubts, talk to us on the [spata Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/fingo-spata/community).

Proposing and submitting a change
---------------------------------

If you would like to make any changes to the project, please:

*   let us know about this by commenting on an existing [issue](https://github.com/fingo/spata/issues)
    or creating a new one and describing your idea,

*   fork and build the project,

*   implement your contribution along with tests and a documentation update,

*   format the code and run the tests,

*   submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

spata follows a standard [fork and pull](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) model for contributions. 

### Building the project

spata requires Java 11 and sbt.

All you need to do to build the project is to run `sbt compile` or preferably `sbt test:compile`.

### Formatting and testing

spata uses [Scalafmt](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/) to coherently and automatically format the code.
To check if code is properly formatted run `sbt scalafmtCheck`. To format all sources run `sbt scalafmtAll`.

spata also uses [Scalafix](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix/) for linting.
You can run a linter check by running `sbt scalafix --check`.

To check both, formatting and linting with single command, run `sbt check`.

Unit and integration tests should be run with `sbt test`.
Test coverage may be verified with `sbt clean coverage test coverageReport`.
Results are written to `target/scala-2.13/scoverage-report/index.html`

Performance tests may be run with `sbt perf:test`.
There is no automatic regression verification for performance test,
however it is still worth running them before and after implementing changes and comparing results.

To check binary compatibility with a previous stable version, please run `sbt mimaReportBinaryIssues`.

API documentation is built with `sbt doc`.

Full project verification before a pull request should be done with:
```shell
sbt -mem 2048 clean check doc test mimaReportBinaryIssues perf:test
```
