**spata** is a functional tabular data (`CSV`) processor for Scala.
The library is backed by [FS2 - Functional Streams for Scala](https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2).

The main goal of the library is to provide handy, functional, stream-based API
with easy conversion between records and case classes, completed with precise information about possible flaws
and their location in source data for parsing while maintaining good performance.
Providing the location of the cause of a parsing error has been the main motivation to develop the library.
It is typically not that hard to parse a well-formatted `CSV` file,
but it could be a nightmare to locate the source of a problem in case of any distortions in a large data file.   

The source (while parsing) and destination (while rendering) data format is assumed to conform basically to
[RFC 4180](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt), but allows some variations - see `CSVConfig` for details.

Getting started
---------------

spata is available for Scala 2.13 and requires at least Java 11.

To use spata you have to add this single dependency to your `build.sbt`:
```sbt
libraryDependencies += "info.fingo" %% "spata" % "<version>"
``` 
The latest version may be found on the badge above.

Link to the current API version is available through the badge as well. 

Basic usage
-----------
The whole parsing process in a simple case may look like this:
```scala
import scala.io.Source
import cats.effect.IO
import fs2.Stream
import info.fingo.spata.CSVParser
import info.fingo.spata.io.Reader

case class Data(item: String, value: Double)
val records = Stream
  // get stream of CSV records while ensuring source cleanup
  .bracket(IO { Source.fromFile("input.csv") })(source => IO { source.close() })
  .through(Reader[IO].by) // produce stream of chars from source
  .through(CSVParser[IO].parse)  // parse CSV file with default configuration and get CSV records 
  .filter(_.get[Double]("value").exists(_ > 1000))  // do some operations using Stream API
  .map(_.to[Data]()) // convert records to case class
  .handleErrorWith(ex => Stream.eval(IO(Left(ex)))) // convert global (I/O, CSV structure) errors to Either
val result = records.compile.toList.unsafeRunSync() // run everything while converting result to list
```

Another example may be taken from [FS2 readme](https://fs2.io/),
assuming that the data is stored and written back in `CSV` format with two fields, `date` and `temp`:
```scala
import java.nio.file.Paths
import scala.io.Codec
import cats.effect.{Blocker, ExitCode, IO, IOApp}
import fs2.Stream
import info.fingo.spata.{CSVParser, CSVRenderer}
import info.fingo.spata.io.{Reader, Writer}

object Converter extends IOApp {

  val converter: Stream[IO, Unit] = Stream.resource(Blocker[IO]).flatMap { blocker =>
    implicit val codec: Codec = Codec.UTF8
    def fahrenheitToCelsius(f: Double): Double = (f - 32.0) * (5.0 / 9.0)

    Reader
      .shifting[IO](blocker)
      .read(Paths.get("testdata/fahrenheit.txt"))
      .through(CSVParser[IO].parse)
      .filter(r => r("temp").exists(!_.isBlank))
      .map(_.altered("temp")(fahrenheitToCelsius))
      .rethrow
      .through(CSVRenderer[IO].render)
      .through(Writer.shifting[IO](blocker).write(Paths.get("testdata/celsius.txt")))
  }

  def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] = converter.compile.drain.as(ExitCode.Success)
}
```
Modified versions of this sample may be found in [error handling](#error-handling) 
and [schema validation](#schema-validation) parts of the tutorial.

More examples of how to use the library may be found in `src/test/scala/info/fingo/spata/sample`.

### Parsing

Core spata operation is a transformation from a stream of characters into a stream of `Record`s.
This is available through `CSVParser.parse` method (supplying FS2 `Pipe`)
and is probably the best way to include `CSV` parsing into any FS2 stream processing pipeline:
```scala
val input: Stream[IO, Char] = ???
val parser: CSVParser[IO] = CSVParser[IO]
val output: Stream[IO, Record] = input.through(parser.parse)
```
In accordance with FS2, spata is polymorphic in the effect type and may be used with different effect implementations
(Cats [IO](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/datatypes/io.html),
Monix [Task](https://monix.io/docs/3x/eval/task.html),
or ZIO [ZIO](https://zio.dev/docs/datatypes/datatypes_io)).
Please note, however, that Cats Effect `IO` is the only effect implementation used for testing and documentation purposes. 
Type class dependencies are defined in terms of the [Cats Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/typeclasses/)class hierarchy.
To support effect suspension, spata requires in general `cats.effect.Sync` type class implementation for its effect type.
Some methods need enhanced type classes to support asynchronous or concurrent computation.

Like in the case of any other FS2 processing, spata consumes only as much of the source stream as required,
give or take a chunk size. 

Field and record delimiters are required to be single characters.
There are however no other assumptions about them - particularly the record delimiter does not have to be a line break
and spata does not assume line break presence in the source data - it does not read the data by lines.

If newline (`LF`, `\n`, `0x0A`) is used as the record delimiter,
carriage return character (`CR`, `\r`, `0x0D`) is automatically skipped if not escaped, to support `CRLF` line breaks.     

Fields containing delimiters (field or record) or quotes have to be wrapped in quotation marks.
As defined in RFC 4180, quotation marks in the content have to be escaped through double quotation marks.

By default, in accordance with the standard, whitespace characters are considered part of the field and are not ignored.
Nonetheless, it is possible to turn on trimming of leading and trailing whitespaces with a configuration option.
This differs from stripping whitespaces from resulting field content
because it distinguishes between quoted and unquoted spaces. For example, having the following input:
```csv
X,Y,Z
xxx," yyy ",zzz
xxx, yyy ,zzz
```
without trimming the content of `Y` field will be `" yyy "` for both records.
With trimming on, we get `" yyy "` for the first record and `"yyy"` for the second.

Please also note, that the following content: 
```csv
X,Y,Z
xxx, " yyy " ,zzz
```
is correct with trimming on (and produces `" yyy "` for field `Y`), but will cause an error without it,
as spaces are considered regular characters in this case and quote has to be put around the whole field.

Not all invisible characters (notably non-breaking space, `'\u00A0'`) are whitespaces.
See Java `Char.isWhitespace` for details.  

In addition to the `parse`, `CSVParser` provides other methods to read `CSV` data:
*   `get`, to load data into `List[Record]`, which may be handy for small data sets,
*   `process`, to deal with data record by record through a callback function,
*   `async`, to process data through a callback function in an asynchronous way.

The three above functions return the result (`List` or `Unit`) wrapped in an effect and require calling one of the
"at the end of the world" methods (`unsafeRunSync` or `unsafeRunAsync` for `cats.effect.IO`) to trigger computation.
```scala
val stream: Stream[IO, Char] = ???
val parser: CSVParser[IO] = CSVParser[IO]
val list: List[Record] = parser.get(stream).unsafeRunSync()
```
Alternatively, instead of calling an unsafe function,
the whole processing may run through [IOApp](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/datatypes/ioapp.html).

If we have to work with a stream of `String`s (e.g. from FS2 `text.utf8Decode`),
we may convert it to a stream of characters:
```scala
val ss: Stream[IO, String] = ???
val sc: Stream[IO, Char] = ss.map(s => Chunk.chars(s.toCharArray)).flatMap(Stream.chunk)
```

See [Reading and writing data](#reading-and-writing-data) for helper methods
to get a stream of characters from various sources.

### Rendering

Complementary to parsing, spata offers `CSV` rendering feature -
it allows conversion from a stream of `Record`s to a stream of characters.
This is available through `CSVRenderer.render` method (supplying FS2 `Pipe`):
```scala
val input: Stream[IO, Record] = ???
val renderer: CSVRenderer[IO] = CSVRenderer[IO]
val output: Stream[IO, Char] = input.through(renderer.render)
```
As with parsing, rendering is polymorphic in the effect type and may be used with different effect implementations.
The renderer has weaker demands for its effect type than parser and requires only the `MonadError` type class implementation.

The `render` method may encode only a subset of fields in a record. This is controlled by the `header` parameter,
being optionally passed to the method:
```scala
val input: Stream[IO, Record] = ???
val header: Header = ???
val renderer: CSVRenderer[IO] = CSVRenderer[IO]
val output: Stream[IO, Char] = input.through(renderer.render(header))
```
The provided header is used to select fields and does not cause adding header row to output.
This is controlled by `CSVConfig.hasHeader` parameter and may be induced even for `render` method without header argument.

If no explicit header is passed to `render`, it is extracted from the first record in the input stream.

The main advantage of using `CSVRenderer` over `makeString` and `intersperse` methods
is its ability to properly escape special characters (delimiters and quotation marks) in source data.
The escape policy is set through configuration and by default, the fields are quoted only when required.

Like parser, renderer supports any single-character field and record delimiters.
As result, the `render` method does not allow separating records with `CRLF`.
If this is required, the `rows` method has to be used:
```scala
val input: Stream[IO, Record] = ???
val output: Stream[IO, String] = input.through(CSVRenderer[IO].rows).intersperse("\r\n")
```
The above stream of strings may be converted to a stream of characters as presented in the [rendering](#rendering) part. 

Unlike `render`, the `rows` method outputs all fields from each record and never outputs the header row.

See [Reading and writing data](#reading-and-writing-data) for helper methods
to transmit a stream of characters to various destinations.

### Configuration

`CSVParser` and `CSVRenderer` are configured through `CSVConfig`, which is a parameter to their constructors.
A more convenient way may be a builder-like method, which takes the defaults and allows altering selected parameters:
```scala
val parser = CSVParser.config.fieldDelimiter(';').noHeader.parser[IO]
val renderer = CSVRenderer.config.fieldDelimiter(';').noHeader.renderer[IO]
```

Individual configuration parameters are described in
`CSVConfig`'s [Scaladoc](https://javadoc.io/doc/info.fingo/spata_2.13/latest/info/fingo/spata/CSVConfig.html).

A specific setting is the header mapping, available through `CSVConfig.mapHeader`.
It allows replacing original header values with more convenient ones or even defining header if no one is present.
When set for the parser, the new values are then used in all operations referencing individual fields,
including automatic conversion to case classes or tuples.
The mapping may be defined only for a subset of fields, leaving the rest in their original form.
```csv
date,max temparature,min temparature
2020-02-02,13.7,-2.2
```
```scala
val stream: Stream[IO, Char] = ???
val parser: CSVParser[IO] =
  CSVParser.config.mapHeader(Map("max temparature" -> "tempMax", "min temparature" -> "tempMin")).parser[IO]
val frosty: Stream[IO, Record] = stream.through(parser.parse).filter(_.get[Double]("minTemp").exists(_ < 0))
```
It may also be defined for more fields than there are present in any particular data source,
which allows using a single parser for multiple datasets with different headers.

There is also index-based header mapping available. It may be used not only to define or redefine header
but to remove duplicates as well:
```csv
date,temparature,temparature
2020-02-02,13.7,-2.2
```
```scala
val stream: Stream[IO, Char] = ???
val parser: CSVParser[IO] =
  CSVParser.config.mapHeader(Map(1 -> "tempMax", 2 -> "tempMin")).parser[IO]
val frosty: Stream[IO, Record] = stream.through(parser.parse).filter(_.get[Double]("minTemp").exists(_ < 0))
```

Header mapping may be used for renderer too, to output different header values from those used by `Record` or case class:
```scala
val stream: Stream[IO, Record] = ???
val renderer: CSVRenderer[IO] =
  CSVRenderer.config.mapHeader(Map("tempMax" -> "max temparature", "tempMin" -> "min temparature")).renderer[IO]
val frosty: Stream[IO, Char] = stream.filter(_.get[Double]("minTemp").exists(_ < 0)).through(renderer.render)
```

FS2 takes care of limiting the amount of processed data and consumed memory to the required level.
This works well to restrict the number of records, nevertheless, each record has to be fully loaded into memory,
no matter how large it is.
This is not a  problem if everything goes well - individual records are typically not that large.
A record can, however, grow uncontrollably in case of incorrect configuration (e.g. wrong record delimiter)
or malformed structure (e.g. unclosed quotation).
To prevent `OutOfMemoryError` in such situations,
spata can be configured to limit the maximum size of a single field using `fieldSizeLimit`.
If this limit is exceeded during parsing, the processing stops with an error. 
By default, no limit is specified.

### Reading and writing data

As mentioned earlier, `CSVParser` requires a stream of characters as its input.
To simplify working with common data sources, like files or sockets, spata provides a few convenience methods,
available through its `io.Reader` object.

Similarly, `io.Writer` simplifies the process of writing a stream of characters produced by `CSVRenderer`
to an external destination.

There are two groups of the `read` and `write` methods in `Reader` and `Writer`:

*   basic ones, accessible through `Reader.plain` and `Writer.plain`,
    where reading and writing is done synchronously on the current thread,

*   with support for [thread shifting](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/datatypes/io.html#thread-shifting),
    accessible through `Reader.shifting` and `Writer.shifting`.

It is recommended to use the thread shifting version, especially for long reading or writing operations,
for better thread pool utilization.
See [a post from Daniel Spiewak](https://gist.github.com/djspiewak/46b543800958cf61af6efa8e072bfd5c)
about thread pools configuration.
More information about threading may be found in
[Cats Concurrency Basics](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/concurrency/basics.html).

The simplest way to read data from and write to a file is:
```scala
val stream: Stream[IO, Char] = Reader.plain[IO].read(Path.of("data.csv"))
// do some processing on stream
val eff: Stream[IO, Unit] = stream.through(Writer.plain[IO].write(Path.of("data.csv")))
```
or even:
```scala
val stream: Stream[IO, Char] = Reader[IO].read(Path.of("data.csv")) // Reader.apply is an alias for Reader.plain
// do some processing on stream
val eff: Stream[IO, Unit] = stream.through(Writer[IO].write(Path.of("data.csv"))) // Writer.apply is an alias for Writer.plain
```
The thread shifting reader and writer provide similar methods, but require implicit `ContextShift`:
```scala
implicit val cs: ContextShift[IO] = IO.contextShift(ExecutionContext.global)
val stream: Stream[IO, Char] = Reader.shifting[IO].read(Path.of("data.csv"))
val eff: Stream[IO, Unit] = stream.through(Writer.shifting[IO].write(Path.of("data.csv")))
```
The `ExecutionContext` provided to `ContextShift` is used to switch the context back to the CPU-bound one,
used for regular, non-blocking operations, after the blocking I/O operation finishes.
The `Blocker`, which provides the thread pool for blocking I/O, may be passed to `shifting` or will be created internally.

All `read` operations load data in [chunks](https://fs2.io/guide.html#chunks) for better performance.
Chunk size may be supplied while creating a reader:
```scala
val stream: Stream[IO, Char] = Reader.plain[IO](1024).read(Path.of("data.csv"))
```
If not provided explicitly, a default chunk size will be used.

Except for `Source`, which is already character-based,
other data sources and all data destinations require an implicit `Codec` to convert bytes into characters:
```scala
implicit val codec: Codec = Codec.UTF8
```

The caller to a `read` or a `write` method which takes a resource as a parameter (`Source`, `InputStream` or `OutputStream`)
is responsible for its cleanup. This may be achieved through FS2 `Stream.bracket`:
```scala
val stream: Stream[IO, Unit] = for {
  source <- Stream.bracket(IO { Source.fromFile("data.csv") })(source => IO { source.close() })
  destination <- Stream.bracket(IO { new FileOutputStream("data.csv") })(fos => IO { fos.close() })
  out <- Reader.shifting[IO].read(source)
    // do some processing
    .through(Writer[IO].write(destination))
} yield out
```
Other methods of resource acquisition and releasing are described in
[Cats Effect tutorial](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/tutorial/tutorial.html#acquiring-and-releasing-resources).

Unlike the `Reader.read` method, which creates a new stream, `Writer.write` operates on an existing stream.
Being often the last operation in the stream pipeline, it has to allow access to the final stream,
being a handle to run the entire processing.
This is why `write` returns a `Pipe`, converting a stream of characters to a unit stream.

There is a `by` method in `Reader`, which returns a `Pipe` too.
It converts a single-element stream containing data source into a stream of characters:
```scala
val stream: Stream[IO, Char] = Stream
  .bracket(IO { Source.fromFile("data.csv") })(source => IO { source.close() })
  .through(Reader.shifting[IO].by)
```

### Getting actual data

Sole `CSV` parsing operation produces a stream of `Record`s.
Each record may be seen as a map from `String` to `String`, where the keys, forming a header,
are shared among all records.
The basic method to obtain individual values is through the call to `apply`, by key (taken from the header):
```scala
val record: Record = ???
val value: Option[String] = record("some key")
```
or index:
```scala
val record: Record = ???
val value: Option[String] = record(0)
```

`CSVRecord` supports retrieval of typed values.
In simple cases, when the value is serialized in its canonical form,
like ISO format for dates, which does not require any additional format information,
or the formatting is fixed for all data, this may be done with single-parameter `get` function:
```scala
val record: Record = ???
val num: Decoded[Double] = record.get[Double]("123.45")
```
`Decoded[A]` is an alias for `Either[ContentError, A]`.
This method requires a `text.StringParser[A]`, which is described in [Text parsing](#text-parsing-and-rendering).

`get` has overloaded versions, which support formatting-aware parsing:
```scala
val record: Record = ???
val df = new DecimalFormat("#,###")
val num: Decoded[Double] = record.get[Double]("123,45", df)
```
This method requires a `text.FormattedStringParser[A, B]`,
which is also described in [Text parsing](#text-parsing-and-rendering).
(It uses an intermediary class `Field` to provide a nice syntax, this should be however transparent in most cases).

Above methods are available also in unsafe, exception-throwing version, accessible through `Record.unsafe` object:
```scala
val record: Record = ???
val v1: String = record.unsafe("key")
val v2: String = record.unsafe(0)
val n1: Double = record.unsafe.get[Double]("123.45")
val df = new DecimalFormat("#,###")
val n2: Double = record.unsafe.get[Double]("123,45", df)
```
They may throw `ContentError` exception.

In addition to retrieval of single fields, a `Record` may be converted to a case class or a tuple.
Assuming a `CSV` data in the following form:
```csv
element,symbol,melting,boiling
hydrogen,H,13.99,20.271
helium,He,0.95,4.222
lithium,Li,453.65,1603
```
the data can be converted from a record directly into a case class:
```scala
val record: Record = ???
case class Element(symbol: String, melting: Double, boiling: Double)
val element: Decoded[Element] = record.to[Element]()
```
Notice that not all source fields have to be used for conversion.
The conversion is name-based - header keys have to match case class field names exactly, including case.
We can use header mapping, described in [Configuration](#configuration), if they do not match.

For tuples, the header has to match tuple field names (`_1`, `_2`, etc.)
and is automatically generated in this form for source data without a header:
```csv
hydrogen,H,13.99,20.271
helium,He,0.95,4.222
lithium,Li,453.65,1603
```
```scala
val record: Record = ???
type Element = (String, String, Double, Double)
val element: Decoded[Element] = record.to[Element]()
```
Notice that in this case the first column has been included in the conversion to ensure header and tuple field matching.

Both forms of conversion require implicit `StringParser`.
Parsers for common types and their default formats are provided through `StringParser` object
and are automatically brought in scope.
Because it is not possible to explicitly provide custom formatter while converting a record into a case class,
an implicit `StringParser` has to be defined in case of specific formats or types:
```csv
element,symbol,melting,boiling
hydrogen,H,"13,99","20,271"
helium,He,"0,95","4,222"
lithium,Li,"453,65","1603"
```
```scala
val record: Record = ???
case class Element(symbol: String, melting: Double, boiling: Double)
val nf = NumberFormat.getInstance(new Locale("pl", "PL"))
implicit val nsp: StringParser[Double] = (str: String) => nf.parse(str).doubleValue()
val element: Decoded[Element] = record.to[Element]()
```

### Creating and modifying records

A `Record` is not only the result of parsing, it is also the source for `CSV` rendering.
To let the renderer do its work, we need to convert the data to records first.
As mentioned above, a `Record` is essentially a map from `String` (key) to `String` (value).
The keys form a header, which is, when only possible, shared among records.
This sharing is always in effect for records parsed by spata but requires some attention
when records are created by application code, especially when performance and memory usage matter.

#### Creating records

The basic way to create a record is to pass values as variable arguments:
```scala
val header = Header("symbol", "melting", "boiling")
val record = Record("H","13.99","20.271")(header)
val value = record("melting")  // returns Some("13.99")
```
The header length is expected to match the number of values (arguments).
If it does not, it is reduced (the last keys are omitted) or extended (tuple-style keys are added).

It is possible to create a record without providing a header and rely on the header that is implicitly generated:
```scala
val record = Record.fromValues("H","13.99","20.271")
val header = record.header  // returns Header("_1", "_2", "_3")
val value = record("_2")  // returns Some("13.99")
```
Because the record's header may be needless in some scenarios (e.g. while using the index-based `CSVRenderer.rows` method),
its implicit creation is lazy - it is postponed until the header is accessed.
If the header is created, each record gets its own copy.

A similar option provides record creation from key-value pairs:
```scala
val record = Record.fromPairs("symbol" -> "H", "melting" -> "13.99", "boiling" -> "20.271")
val value = record("melting")  // returns Some("13.99")
```
This method creates a header per record and it should not be used with large data sets.

All three above methods require record values to be already converted to strings.
However, what we often need, is to create a record from typed data, with proper formatting / locale.
There are two methods to achieve that.

The first one is to employ a record builder, which allows adding typed values to the record one by one:
```scala
val record = Record.builder.add("symbol", "H").add("melting", 13.99).add("boiling", 20.271).get
val value = record("melting")  // returns Some("13.99")
```
To convert a typed value to a string, this method requires an implicit `StringRenderer[A]`,
which is described in [Text rendering](#text-parsing-and-rendering).
Similarly to `StringParser`, renderers for basic types and formats are provided out of the box
and specific ones may be implemented:
```scala
val nf = NumberFormat.getInstance(new Locale("pl", "PL"))
implicit val nsr: StringRenderer[Double] = (v: Double) => nf.format(v)
val record = Record.builder.add("symbol", "H").add("melting", 13.99).add("boiling", 20.271).get
val value = record("melting")  // returns Some("13,99")
```

The second method allows direct conversion of cases classes or tuples to records:
```scala
case class Element(symbol: String, melting: Double, boiling: Double)
val element = Element("H", 13.99, 20.271)
val record = Record.from(element)
val value = record("melting")  // returns Some("13.99")
```
This approach relies on `StringRenderer` for data formatting as well.
It may be used even more comfortably by calling a method directly on case class:
```scala
val nf = NumberFormat.getInstance(new Locale("pl", "PL"))
implicit val nsr: StringRenderer[Double] = (v: Double) => nf.format(v)
case class Element(symbol: String, melting: Double, boiling: Double)
val element = Element("H", 13.99, 20.271)
val record = element.toRecord
val value = record("melting")  // returns Some("13,99")
```

A disadvantage of both above methods operating on typed values is header creation for each record.
They may be not the optimal choice for large data sets when performance matters.

#### Modifying records

Sometimes only a few fields of the original record have to be modified and the rest remains intact.
In such situations, it may be much more convenient to modify a record instead of creating a new one from scratch,
especially for large records.
Because spata supports functional code,
modifying means the creation of a copy of the record with selected fields set to new values.

The simplest way is to provide a new string value for a record field, referenced by key or index:
```scala
val record: Record = ???
val modified: Record = record.updated(0, "new value").updated("key", "another value")
```

It is also possible to access existing value while updating record:
```scala
val record: Record = ???
val modified: Record = record.updatedWith(0)(v => v.toUpperCase).updatedWith("key")(v => v.toUpperCase)
```

The record provides a method to modify typed values too:
```scala
val record: Record = ???
val altered: Either[ContentError, Record] = record.altered("int value")((i: Int) => i % 2 == 0)
```
or in extended form:
```scala
val dateFormat = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd.MM.yy")
implicit val ldsp: StringParser[LocalDate] = (str: String) => LocalDate.parse(str, dateFormat)
implicit val ldsr: StringRenderer[LocalDate] = (ld: LocalDate) => dateFormat.format(ld)
val record: Record = ???
val altered: Either[ContentError, Record] = for {
  r1 <- record.altered("field 1")((d: Double) => d.abs)
  r2 <- r1.altered("field 2")((ld: LocalDate) => ld.plusDays(1))
} yield r2
```
Please note, however, that this method may produce an error
because the source values have to be parsed before being passed to the updating function.
To support value parsing and rendering,
an implicit `StringParser[A]` and `StringRenderer[B]` have to be provided for specific data formats.

All the above methods preserve record structure and keep existing record header.
It is also possible to modify the structure, if necessary:
```scala
val record: Record = ???
val modified: Record = record.patch.remove("field 1").add("field 10", 3.14).get
```
`Record.patch` employs `RecordBuilder` to enhance or reduce record.
See [Creating records](#creating-records) above for more information.

### Text parsing and rendering

`CSV` data is parsed as `String`s.
We often need typed values, e.g. numbers or dates, for further processing.
There is no standard, uniform interface available for Scala or Java to parse strings to different types.
Numbers may be parsed using `java.text.NumberFormat`.
Dates and times through `parse` methods in `java.time.LocalDate` or `LocalTime`, taking format as an argument.
This is awkward when providing a single interface for various types as `Record` does.
This is the place where spata's `text.StringParser` comes in handy.

The situation is similar when typed values have to be converted to strings to create `CSV` data.
Although there is a `toString` method available for each value, it is often insufficient,
because a specific format of dates, numbers, and other values may be required.
Again, there is no single interface for encoding different types into strings.
spata provides `text.StringRenderer` to help with this.

Similar solutions in other libraries are often called `Decoder` and `Encoder` in place of `Parser` and `Renderer`.

#### Parsing text

`StringParser` object provides methods for parsing strings with default or implicitly provided format:
```scala
val num: ParseResult[Double] = StringParser.parse[Double]("123.45")
```
where `ParseResult[A]` is just an alias for `Either[ParseError, A]`.

When a specific format has to be provided, an overloaded version of the above method is available: 
```scala
val df = new DecimalFormat("#,###")
val num: ParseResult[Double] = StringParser.parse[Double]("123,45", df)
```
(It uses intermediary class `Pattern` to provide nice syntax,
this should be however transparent in most cases).

These functions require implicit `StringParser` or `FormattedStringParser` respectively.
Implicits for a few basic types are already available - see Scaladoc for `StringParser`.
When additional parsers are required,
they may be easily provided by implementing `StringParser` or `FormattedStringParser` traits.

Let's take `java.sql.Date` as an example. Having implemented `StringParser[Date]`:
```scala
implicit val sdf: StringParser[Date] = (s: String) => Date.valueOf(s)
```
we can use it as follows:
```scala
val date = StringParser.parse[Date]("2020-02-02")
```

Defining a parser with support for custom formatting requires the implementation of `FormattedStringParser`:
```scala
implicit val sdf: FormattedStringParser[Date, DateFormat] =
  new FormattedStringParser[Date, DateFormat] {
      override def apply(str: String): Date = Date.valueOf(str.strip)
      override def apply(str: String, fmt: DateFormat): Date =  new Date(fmt.parse(str.strip).getTime)
  }
```
and can be used as follows:
```scala
val df = DateFormat.getDateInstance(DateFormat.SHORT, new Locale("pl", "PL"))
val date = StringParser.parse[Date]("02.02.2020", df)
```
Please note that this sample implementation accepts partial string parsing,
e.g. `"02.02.2020xyz"` will successfully parse to `2020-02-02`.
This is different from the built-in parsing behavior for `LocalDate`,
where the entire string has to conform to the format. 

Parsing implementations are expected to throw specific runtime exceptions when parsing fails.
This is converted to `ParseError` in `StringParser` object's `parse` method
while keeping the original exception in the `cause` field.

Although this design decision might be seen as questionable,
as returning `Either` instead of throwing an exception could be the better choice,
it is made deliberately - all available Java parsing methods throw an exception,
so it is more convenient to use them directly while implementing `StringParser` traits,
leaving all exception handling in a single place, i.e. the `StringParser.parse` method.

#### Rendering text

Rendering is symmetrical with parsing. 
`StringRenderer` object provides methods for rendering strings with default or implicitly provided format:
```scala
val str: String = StringRenderer.render(123.45)
```

When a specific format has to be provided, an overloaded version of the above method is available: 
```scala
val df = new DecimalFormat("#,###")
val str: String = StringRenderer.render(123.45, df)
```

These functions require implicit `StringRenderer` or `FormattedStringRenderer` respectively.
Implicits for a few basic types are already available - see Scaladoc for `StringRenderer`.
When additional renderers are required,
they may be easily provided by implementing `StringRenderer` or `FormattedStringRenderer` traits.

Let's take again `java.sql.Date` as an example. Having implemented `StringRenderer[Date]`:
```scala
implicit val sdf: StringRenderer[Date] = (d: Date) => if(d == null) "" else d.toString
```
we can use it as follows:
```scala
val date = Date.valueOf(LocalDate.now)
val str = StringRenderer.render(date)
```

Defining a renderer with support for custom formatting requires the implementation of `FormattedStringRenderer`:
```scala
implicit val sdf: FormattedStringRenderer[Date, DateFormat] =
  new FormattedStringRenderer[Date, DateFormat] {
      override def apply(date: Date): String = date.toString
      override def apply(date: Date, fmt: DateFormat): String = fmt.format(date)
  }
```
and can be used as follows:
```scala
val df = DateFormat.getDateInstance(DateFormat.SHORT, new Locale("pl", "PL"))
val date = Date.valueOf(LocalDate.now)
val str = StringRenderer.render(date, df)
```

### Schema validation

Successful `CSV` parsing means that the underlying source has the correct format (taking into account parser configuration). 
Nonetheless, the obtained records may have any content - being a collection of strings they are very permissive.
We often require strict data content and format to be able to use it in accordance with our business logic.
Therefore spata supports basic fields' format definition and validation.

`CSV` schema can be defined using `schema.CSVSchema`:
```scala
val schema = CSVSchema()
  .add[String]("symbol")
  .add[LocalDateTime]("time")
  .add[BigDecimal]("price")
  .add[String]("currency")
```
Schema is basically specified by the names of expected `CSV` fields and their data types.

We do not need to include every field from the `CSV` source in the schema definition.
It is enough to do it only for those fields we are interested in.

Schema is validated as part of a regular stream processing pipeline:
```scala
val schema = ???
val stream: Stream[IO, Char] = ???
val validatedStream = stream.through(CSVParser[IO].parse).through(schema.validate)
```
As a result of the validation process, the ordinary `CSV` `Record` is converted to `ValidatedRecord[T]`,
which is an alias for `Validated[InvalidRecord, TypedRecord[T]]`.
The parametric type `T` is the compile-time, [shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless) based
representation of the record data type. Because it depends on the schema definition and is quite elaborate,
we are not able to manually provide it - we have to let the compiler infer it.
This is why the type signatures are omitted from some variable definitions in code excerpts in this chapter.
Although the compiler infers the types correctly, the IDEs and linters often wrongly report problems with the source code.
Please do not be held back by red marks in your code editor.

[Validated](https://typelevel.org/cats/datatypes/validated.html) is a Cats data type for wrapping validation results.
It is similar to `Either`, with `Valid` corresponding to `Right` and `Invalid` to `Left`,
but more suitable for validation scenarios. Please reach for Cats documentation for an in-depth introduction.

The compile-time nature of this process makes future record handling fully type-safe:
```scala
val validatedStream = ???
validatedStream.map { validated =>
  validated.map { typedRecord =>
    val symbol: String = typedRecord("symbol")
    val price: BigDecimal = typedRecord("price")
    // ...
  }
}
```
Please notice, that in contrast to the regular record, where the result is wrapped in `Decoded[T]`,
we always get the straight type out of typed record.
If we try to access a non-existing field (not defined by schema) or assign it to a wrong value type,
we will get a compilation error:
```scala
val typedRecord = ???
val price: BigDecimal = typedRecord("prce") // does not compile 
```

The key (field name) used to access the record value is a [literal type](https://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/42.type.html).
To be accepted by a typed record, the key has to be a literal value or a variable having a singleton type:
```scala
val typedRecord = ???
val narrow: "symbol" = "symbol" // singleton
val wide = "symbol" // String
val symbol1 = typedRecord("symbol")  // OK
val symbol2 = typedRecord(narrow)  // OK
val symbol3 = typedRecord(wide)  // does not compile
```

Typed records, similarly to regular ones, support conversion to case classes:
```scala
case class StockPrice(symbol: String, price: BigDecimal)
val typedRecord = ???
val stockPrice: StockPrice = typedRecord.to[StockPrice]()
```
Like in the case of [regular records](#getting-actual-data),
the conversion is name-based and may cover only a subset of a record's fields.
However, in contrast to a regular record, the result is not wrapped in `Decoded` anymore.

A field declared in the schema has to be present in the source stream.
Moreover, its values, by default, must not be empty.
If values are optional, they have to be clearly marked as such in the schema definition:
```scala
val schema = CSVSchema()
  .add[String]("symbol")
  .add[Option[LocalDateTime]]("time")
```
Please note, that this still requires the field (column) to be present, only permits it to contain empty values.

While processing a validated stream, we have access to invalid data as well: 
```scala
val validatedStream = ???
validatedStream.map { validated =>
  validated.map { typedRecord =>
    val price: BigDecimal = typedRecord("price")
    // ...
  }.leftMap { invalid =>
    val price: Option[String] = invalid.record("price")
    // ...
  }
}
```
(the above `map`/`leftMap` combination may be simplified to `bimap`).

Schema validation requires string parsing, described in the previous chapter.
Similarly to the conversion to case classes, we are not able to directly pass a formatter to the validation,
so a regular `StringParser` implicit with the correct format has to be provided for each parsed type.
All remarks described in [Text parsing and rendering](#text-parsing-and-rendering) apply to the validation process.

Type verification, although probably the most important aspect of schema validation,
is often not the only constraint on `CSV` required to successfully process the data.
We often have to check if the values match many other business rules.
spata provides a mean to declaratively verify basic constraints on the field level:
```scala
val schema = CSVSchema()
  .add[String]("symbol", LengthValidator(3, 5))
  .add[LocalDateTime]("time")
  .add[BigDecimal]("price", MinValidator(BigDecimal(0.01)))
  .add[String]("currency", LengthValidator(3))
```
Records that do not pass the provided schema validators render the result invalid, as in the case of a wrong type.

It is possible to provide multiple validators for each field.
The validation process for a field is stopped on the first failing validator.
The order of running validators is not specified.
Nevertheless, the validation is run independently for each field defined by the schema.
The returned `InvalidRecord` contains error information from all incorrect fields.   

The validators are defined in terms of typed (already correctly parsed) values.
A bunch of typical ones is available as part of `info.fingo.spata.schema.validator` package.
Additional ones may be provided by implementing the `schema.validator.Validator` trait.

The converter example presented in [Basic usage](#basic-usage) may be improved to take advantage of schema validation:
```scala
import java.nio.file.Paths
import java.time.LocalDate
import scala.io.Codec
import cats.effect.{Blocker, ExitCode, IO, IOApp}
import fs2.Stream
import info.fingo.spata.{CSVParser, CSVRenderer, Record}
import info.fingo.spata.io.{Reader, Writer}
import info.fingo.spata.schema.CSVSchema

object Converter extends IOApp {

  val converter: Stream[IO, Unit] = Stream.resource(Blocker[IO]).flatMap { blocker =>
    implicit val codec: Codec = Codec.UTF8
    val schema = CSVSchema().add[LocalDate]("date").add[Double]("temp")
    def fahrenheitToCelsius(f: Double): Double = (f - 32.0) * (5.0 / 9.0)

    Reader
      .shifting[IO](blocker)
      .read(Paths.get("testdata/fahrenheit.txt"))
      .through(CSVParser[IO].parse)
      .through(schema.validate)
      .map {
        _.leftMap(println).map { tr =>
          val date = tr("date")
          val temp = fahrenheitToCelsius(tr("temp"))
          Record.builder.add("date", date).add("temp", temp).get
        }.toOption
      }
      .unNone
      .through(CSVRenderer[IO].render)
      .through(Writer.shifting[IO](blocker).write(Paths.get("testdata/celsius.txt")))
  }

  def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] = converter.compile.drain.as(ExitCode.Success)
}
```

### Error handling

There are three types of errors that may arise while parsing `CSV`:

*   Various I/O errors, including but not limited to `IOException`.
    They are not directly related to parsing logic but `CSV` is typically read from an external, unreliable source.
    They may be raised by `Reader` operations.

*   Errors caused by malformed `CSV` structure reported as `StructureException`.
    They may be caused by `CSVParser`'s methods.

*   Errors caused by unexpected / incorrect data in record fields reported as `HeaderError` or `DataError`.
    They may result from interactions with `Record`.
    Alternatively, when schema validation is in use,
    this type of error results in `InvalidRecord` with `SchemaError`s (one per each field) being yielded.
    More precisely, `HeaderError` and `DataError` are wrapped in `TypeError`
    while any custom validation problem is reported as `ValidationError`. 

The two first error categories are unrecoverable and stop stream processing.
For the `StructureException` errors, we can precisely identify the place that caused the problem.
See Scaladoc for `CSVException` for further information about the error location.

The last category is reported on the record level and allows for different handling policies.
Please notice, however, that if the error is not handled locally (e.g. using safe functions returning `Decoded`)
and propagates through the stream, further processing of input data is stopped, like for the above error categories.

As for rendering, there are basically two types of errors possible:

*   Errors caused by missing records keys, including records of different structures rendered together.
    They are reported on record level with `HeaderError`.

*   Similarly to parsing, various I/O errors, when using `Writer`.

Errors are raised and should be handled by using the [FS2 error handling](https://fs2.io/guide.html#error-handling) mechanism.
FS2 captures exceptions thrown or reported explicitly with `raiseError`
and in both cases is able to handle them with `handleErrorWith`.
To fully support this, `CSVParser` and `CSVRenderer` require the `RaiseThrowable` type class instance for its effect type,
which is covered with `cats.effect.Sync` type class for the parser.

The converter example presented in [Basic usage](#basic-usage) may be enriched with explicit error handling:
```scala
import java.nio.file.Paths
import scala.io.Codec
import scala.util.Try
import cats.effect.{Blocker, ExitCode, IO, IOApp}
import fs2.Stream
import info.fingo.spata.{CSVParser, CSVRenderer, Record}
import info.fingo.spata.io.{Reader, Writer}

object Converter extends IOApp {

  val converter: Stream[IO, ExitCode] = Stream.resource(Blocker[IO]).flatMap { blocker =>
    def fahrenheitToCelsius(f: Double): Double = (f - 32.0) * (5.0 / 9.0)
    implicit val codec: Codec = Codec.UTF8
    val src = Paths.get("testdata/fahrenheit.txt")
    val dst = Paths.get("testdata/celsius.txt")

    Reader
      .shifting[IO](blocker)
      .read(src)
      .through(CSVParser[IO].parse)
      .filter(r => r("temp").exists(!_.isBlank))
      .map { r =>
        for {
          date <- r.get[String]("date")
          fTemp <- r.get[Double]("temp")
          cTemp = fahrenheitToCelsius(fTemp)
        } yield Record.builder.add("date", date).add("temp", cTemp).get
      }
      .rethrow
      .through(CSVRenderer[IO].render)
      .through(Writer.shifting[IO](blocker).write(dst))
      .fold(ExitCode.Success)((z, _) => z)
      .handleErrorWith { ex =>
        Try(dst.toFile.delete())
        Stream.eval(IO(println(ex)) *> IO(ExitCode.Error))
      }
  }

  def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] = converter.compile.lastOrError
}
```

The `rethrow` method in the above code raises an error for `Left`, converting `Either` to simple values.

Sometimes we would like to convert a stream to a collection.
We should wrap the result in `Either` in such situations to distinguish successful processing from erroneous one.
See the first code snippet in [Basic usage](#basic-usage) for sample.

### Logging

Logging is turned off by default in spata (no-op logger) and may be activated by defining implicit `util.Logger`,
passing an SLF4J logger instance to it:
```scala
val slf4jLogger = LoggerFactory.getLogger("spata")
implicit val spataLogger: Logger[IO] = new Logger[IO](slf4jLogger)
```
spata does not create per-class loggers but uses the provided one for all logging operations.

All logging operations are deferred in the stream effect and executed as part of effect evaluation,
together with main effectful operations.

The logging is currently limited to only a few events per parsed `CSV` source (single `info` entry,
a couple of `debug` entries, and possibly an `error` entry). There are no log events generated per `CSV` record.
No stack trace is recorded for `error` events.

The `debug` level introduces additional operations on the stream and may slightly impact performance.

No parsed data is explicitly written to the log.
This can however occur when the `CSV` source is assumed to have a header row, but it does not.
The first record of data is then assumed to be the header and is logged at debug level.
Please do not use the debug level if data security is crucial.

Alternatives
