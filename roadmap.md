Development plans
-----------------

The library provides already a practical solution although with reasonable feature set.
There are however many features which should made it even better.  
Planned development includes:
* Automating builds and deployments (CI). 
* Enhancing this readme to provide gentle introduction to the library.
* Testing / better supporting asynchronous execution.
* Providing logging.
* Using FS2 I/O library in addition to Scala's `Source`.
* Parsing chunks instead of single elements.
* Declaring schema and providing its validation.
