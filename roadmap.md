Development plans
-----------------

The library provides already a practical solution although with reasonable feature set.
There are however many features which should made it even better.  
Planned development includes:
* Parsing chunks instead of single elements.
* Providing logging.
The above topics should conclude version 1.0

Future versions may include:
* Declaring schema and providing its validation.
* CSV writer.
