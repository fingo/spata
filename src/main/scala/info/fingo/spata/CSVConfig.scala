/** CSV configuration used to create [[CSVParser]] or [[CSVRenderer]].
  *
  * This config may be used as a builder to create a parser :
  * {{{ val parser = CSVConfig().fieldSizeLimit(1000).noHeader.parser[IO] }}}
  * or renderer:
  * {{{ val renderer = CSVConfig().escapeSpaces.noHeader.renderer[IO] }}}
  *
  * Field delimiter is `','` by default.
  *
  * Record delimiter is `'\n'` by default. When the delimiter is set to line feed (`'\n'`, ASCII 10)
  * and it is preceded by carriage return (`'\r'`, ASCII 13), they are treated as a single character.
  *
  * Quotation mark is `'"'` by default.
  * It is required to wrap special characters, field and record delimiters, in quotes.
  * Quotation mark in actual content may appear only inside quotation marks.
  * It has to be doubled to be interpreted as part of actual data, not a control character.
  *
  * While parsing, the header setting defines if a header is present in source data, which is true by default.
  * Header is used as keyset for actual values and not included in data.
  * If there is no header, a number-based keys, in tuple style, are created (starting from `"_1"`).
  * While rendering, the header setting defines if header row should be added to output.
  * If no header is explicitly defined, a number-based one is used, like for parsing.
  *
  * If CSV records are converted to case classes, header values are used as class fields and may require remapping.
  * This can be achieved through [[mapHeader(* mapHeader]]:
  * {{{config.mapHeader(Map("first name" -> "firstName", "last name" -> "lastName")))}}}
  * or if an implicit header is generated:
  * {{{config.mapHeader(Map("_1" -> "firstName", "_2" -> "lastName")))}}}
  * Header mapping may be also position-based, which is especially handy when there are duplicates in header
  * and name-based remapping does not solve it (because it remaps all occurrences):
  * {{{config.mapHeader(Map(0 -> "firstName", 1 -> "lastName")))}}}
  * Remapping may be used for renderer as well,
  * allowing customized header while converting data from case classes or tuples.
  *
  * Unescaped fields with leading or trailing spaces may be automatically trimmed while parsing
  * when `trimSpaces` is set to `true`.
  * This setting is `false` by default and white spaces are preserved, even for unescaped fields.
  *
  * Field size limit is used to stop processing input when it is significantly larger then expected
  * to avoid `OutOfMemoryError`.
  * This might happen if the source structure is invalid, e.g. the closing quotation mark is missing.
  * There is no limit by default.
  *
  * While rendering CSV content, different quoting polices may be used, which is controlled by `escapeMode` setting.
  * By default only fields which contain field delimiter, record delimiter or quotation mark are put into quotes.
  * When set to `EscapeSpaces` quotes are put additionally around fields with leading or trailing spaces.
  * `EscapeAll` results in putting quotes around all fields.
  *
  * @param fieldDelimiter field (cell) separator, `','` by default
  * @param recordDelimiter record (row) separator, `'\n'` by default
  * @param quoteMark character used to wrap (quote) field content, `'"'` by default
  * @param hasHeader set if data starts with header row, `true` by default
  * @param headerMap definition of header remapping, by name or index, empty by default
  * @param trimSpaces flag to strip spaces, `false` by default, valid only for parsing
  * @param fieldSizeLimit maximal size of a field, `None` by default, valid only for parsing
  * @param escapeMode method of escaping fields, `EscapeRequired` by default, valid only for rendering
