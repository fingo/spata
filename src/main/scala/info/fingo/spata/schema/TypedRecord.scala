/** CSV record representation with type-safe access to its values.
  * Typed records are created as result of schema validation.
  *
  * Typed records values are accessed similarly to regular records, as values referenced by string keys.
  * In contract to regular record, however, the keys are verified at compile time. See [[apply]] method for more.
  * The returned value has already required type, as declared by schema definition:
  * {{{ val id: Int = record("id") }}}
  *
  * Thanks to this, in contrast to a regular [[Record]], field access operation through [[apply]]
  * and conversion to case class through [[to]] returns required type directly, without wrapping it in `Either`.
  *
  * For `lineNum` and `rowNum` description see [[Record]].
  *
  * @see [[CSVSchema]] for information about schema validation.
  * @param data the actual record's data
  * @param lineNum last line number in source file this record is built from
  * @param rowNum row number in source file this record comes from
  * @tparam L data type - heterogeneous list

    * To achieve this, the provided key is required to have a singleton type. This works out of the box for literals,
    * but has to be declared explicitly for variables:

    * val v2 = record(key) // OK
    * val wrong = "key"
    * val v3 = record(wrong) // does not compile

    * (the proper type is inferred, you do not have to provide it explicitly):
    * {{{ val value: Double = record("value") }}}
    * The formal return type, `selector.Out`, is a bit baffling, because it is fixed by calling code.
